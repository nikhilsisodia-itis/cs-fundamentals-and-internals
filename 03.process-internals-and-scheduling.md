# Process Internals and Switching

## 1. Introduction to Processes

### 1.1. What is a process?

- A process is a running instance of a program.
- It’s the OS’s way of tracking and managing all active programs.
- Example:
  - The Firefox application file on disk → /usr/bin/firefox
  - When user opens it, OS loads it into memory → creates a process.
- That process has:
  - Its own memory area.
  - Unique ID (PID).
  - Registers, program counter, and stack.
  - Permissions and owner.
  - Parent process.

### 1.2. Program VS Process

| Program | Process |
| - | - |
| Static file stored on disk. | Running instance in memory. |
| Passive (does nothing until run) | Active (uses CPU, memory, etc.) |
| Example: `/usr/bin/vim` | Example: `PID 1472 running vim` |
