# The Operating System

## 1. Introduction to Operating System

### 1.1 What is an OS?

- A computer’s operating system is system software that:
  - Manages all hardware resources (CPU, memory, disks, devices).
  - Provides an interface for applications and users.
  - Controls how processes run and interact.
- OS acts as a manager for hardware and software resources.

### 1.2 OS Componenets overview

- The OS is made up of several key layers:

```bash
+--------------------+
| User Applications  | ← e.g., Browser, Text Editor
+--------------------+
| System Libraries   | ← e.g., libc, shared libs
+--------------------+
| System Calls       | ← interface between user and kernel
+--------------------+
| Kernel             | ← Core of the OS
+--------------------+
| Hardware           |
+--------------------+
```

### 1.3 The two worlds of the OS

| Concept | Description | Examples |
| - | - | - |
| **Kernel Space** | Where the core OS code runs — has direct access to hardware. | Device drivers, memory management, scheduling. |
| **User Space** | Where user applications run — limited privileges. | Firefox, Terminal, File Manager. |

### 1.4 Kernel Responsibilities

| Function | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| **Process Management** | Controls program execution (starting, scheduling, ending). | `ps`, `top`, `kill` |
| **Memory Management** | Allocates and tracks memory usage. | `free -h`, `vmstat` |
| **Device Management** | Manages drivers for hardware devices. | `lsmod`, `lspci`, `lsusb` |
| **File System Management** | Controls data storage and access. | `ls`, `df -h`, `mount` |
| **System Calls** | Provides safe access from user apps to hardware. | `read()`, `write()`, `open()` |
