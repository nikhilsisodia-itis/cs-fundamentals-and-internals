# Firmware and Boot Process

## 1. Introduction to Booting

### 1.1 What is Booting?

- Booting is the process by which a computer starts up.
- The booting process initializes hardware, and loads the operating system into memory so it can run.

### 1.2 The Complete Boot Process Overview

```bash
Power ON
   ↓
Firmware (BIOS / UEFI)
   ↓
POST (Power-On Self Test)
   ↓
Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)
   ↓
Kernel (core of OS)
   ↓
Init / Systemd (starts system services)
   ↓
User Space (login, desktop, shell)
```

## 2. Stage 1- Power ON

### 2.1 What happens when a user powers on a computer?

- User presses the power button.
- PSU (Power Supply Unit) sends electricity to motherboard and its components.
- CPU starts executing code from a predefined memory location.
- This code is part of the firmware (BIOS/UEFI).
- So, the very first code that runs is not from the SSD or OS — it’s from firmware stored on the motherboard.

## 3. Stage 2- Firmware (BIOS / UEFI)

### 3.1 What is Firmware?

- Firmware is low-level software stored on a non-volatile chip (ROM/Flash memory) on your motherboard.
- It’s the bridge between hardware and the operating system.
- Common types of firmware are BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).

### 3.2 BIOS vs UEFI

#### 3.2.1 BIOS

- Stands for Basic Input Output System.
- The older firmware standard.
- Stored in a ROM chip.
- Operates in 16-bit real mode.
- Uses MBR (Master Boot Record) partition scheme.
- Limited to booting drives ≤ 2 TB.

#### 3.2.2 UEFI

- Stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.
- The modern replacement for BIOS.
- Stored in flash memory.
- Operates in 32-bit or 64-bit mode.
- Uses GPT (GUID Partition Table) — supports drives > 2 TB.
- Has graphical interface and mouse support.
- Can access network & secure boot options.

### 3.3 Firmware Responsibilities

| Task | Description |
| - | - |
| Power-on initialization | Activates CPU, memory, storage, and I/O |
| POST (Power-On Self-Test) | Checks if essential components work properly |
| Boot Device Selection | Chooses where to boot from (SSD, USB, Network) |
| Loads Bootloader | Reads bootloader file from selected device |
| Passes Control | Hands over control to the bootloader |

### 3.4 Accessing BIOS/UEFI

- At startup, press:
  - F2 or DEL (common for laptops like HP/ASUS).
  - ESC, F10, or F12 (depends on model).
- You’ll enter the firmware setup utility.

## 4. Stage 3- POST (Power-On Self Test)

### 4.1 What is POST?

- POST is a diagnostic testing sequence run by the firmware.
- It checks the essential hardware components (RAM, CPU, GPU, storage devices).
- If all tests pass, the boot process continues.
- If a test fails, it may produce beep codes or error messages.

### 4.2 Common POST Errors

| Error Type | Description | Possible Fixes |
| - | - | - |
| Beep Codes | Series of beeps indicating hardware issues | Check motherboard manual for beep code meanings |
| No Display | Monitor remains blank | Check GPU connection, reseat RAM |
| Keyboard/Mouse Not Detected | Peripherals not recognized | Try different USB ports or replace devices |
| Hard Drive Not Detected | Storage device not found | Check SATA/Power cables, BIOS settings |
