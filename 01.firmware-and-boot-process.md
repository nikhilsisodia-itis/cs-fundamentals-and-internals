# Firmware and Boot Process

## 1. Introduction to Booting

### 1.1 What is Booting?

- Booting is the process by which a computer starts up.
- The booting process initializes hardware, and loads the operating system into memory so it can run.

### 1.2 The Complete Boot Process Overview

```bash
Power ON
   ↓
Firmware (BIOS / UEFI)
   ↓
POST (Power-On Self Test)
   ↓
Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)
   ↓
Kernel (core of OS)
   ↓
Init / Systemd (starts system services)
   ↓
User Space (login, desktop, shell)
```

## 2. Stage 1- Power ON

### 2.1 What happens when a user powers on a computer?

- User presses the power button.
- PSU (Power Supply Unit) sends electricity to motherboard and its components.
- CPU starts executing code from a predefined memory location.
- This code is part of the firmware (BIOS/UEFI).
- So, the very first code that runs is not from the SSD or OS — it’s from firmware stored on the motherboard.
